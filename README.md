This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

In order to start this project, you need to run 2 command

First, run the server

```bash
npm run server
# or
yarn server
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/data) with your browser to see the api.

This project is not using Nextjs Built-in API because I want to see real changes data but I don't use any database here.

So, json-server is used to built the API for this project.
